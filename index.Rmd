title: "COVID-19 Effects on Mental Health/Behaviors of Both Adults and Students"
description: |
  This is where I will be showcasing my Final Project for David Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp. For my final project, I wanted to do something that was relatable to me and was something that I experienced throughout the Pandemic because this world event is something that I'll probably only experience once in my lifetime.

### Goals

* The main goal of this project is to actually create a website that will contain more data about mental health in general. I chose to start with COVID-19 data because it's the most recent event as to when this website was created. This little bit of data is just a start to more data regarding mental health disorders, treatments, statistics, etc. 

* The goal of this final project though is to see the effects or relationships between the student environment COVID affected and their behaviors.
