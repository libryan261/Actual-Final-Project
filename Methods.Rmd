### What we used
Our group used a multiple linear regression method in order to look into the racial inequality in the housing market. The regression equation that we used was Y = a + B1X1  + B2X2 + B3X3 + B4X4 + .... The “Y” in the equation is the outcome so in our case it's the median house value. The “a” is the intercept in the equation. The “B” are the slope parameters and the “X” are the independent variables.

X1 - median number of rooms
X2 - the median home age
X3 - the education quality
X4 - the jobs index
X5 - the health and environment quality
X6 - the social and economic quality
X7 - the population density
X8 - the majority minority
