I am currently a rising senior at Dublin Coffman High School. Some of my hobbies include playing tennis, playing violin, volunteering in my community, and helping grow myself as a person. This is my first time ever interacting with anytype of code and will be my first project done with code. I plan on adding more to this and make it more of a general page about mental health. If you wanna talk to me or ask any questions, feel free to reach out to me! I will add my handles below. Thank you for viewing my page!\nInsta: _bryanli\nSnap: bli735\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "With schools transitioning into online learning as a result of the pandemic, many students have struggled transitioning into a new learning environment. As a result, lots of students haven't been able to learn the content of a course through the traditional teaching time, which led many to adapt to self-studying and relying on themselves to learn the content. This graph here analyzes the relationship between those who had different Online class experiences and their time spent on self learning the material.\n",

      "description": "This one also looks at adults along with students. One of the consequences or side effects of schools/jobs having their work transfer to an online platform is having students or employees locked at home for at least eight hours watching a screen. Especially with the suspension of sports, closing of gyms, this left people without a reliable mean of exercise and having them stay inside all day on their devices. Reasonably, this lead to a spike in health issues among youthWhile this one also includes physical health when looking at Heath Issues, it is still a really important factor to look at along with mental health. After all, physical health issues can also lead to mental health issues. \n",

      "contents": "\nGoals\n*The main goal of this project is to actually create a website that will contain more data about mental health in general. I chose to start with COVID-19 data because itâ€™s the most recent event as to when this website was created. This little bit of data is just a start to more data regarding mental health disorders, treatments, statistics, etc.\n*The goal of this final project though is to see the effects or relationships between the student environment COVID affected and their behaviors.\n\n\n\n",
