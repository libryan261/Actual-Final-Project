### About Me
My name is Bryan Li. I am currently a rising senior at Dublin Coffman High School. Some of my hobbies include playing tennis, playing violin, volunteering in my community, and helping grow myself as a person. This is my first time ever interacting with anytype of code and will be my first project done with code. I plan on adding more to this and make it more of a general page about mental health. If you wanna talk to me or ask any questions, feel free to reach out to me! I will add my handles below. Thank you for viewing my page!
