title: "Mental Health of Adults during COVID-19 lockdown"
description: |
  These graphs below are from KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation). I thought that these graphs and extra information really helps demonstrate the mental effects placed on many from COVID and clearly shows the before and after changes. The first graph shows adults' mental state before COVID and after. The second graph shows symptons expressed by people during the pandemic.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(distill)
library(knitr)

```



```{r ,echo= FALSE}

include_graphics("images/adult2.png")





```


### Interpretation

The bar graph is pretty self explanatory. It accounts for adults and if they have anxiety or depression before the COVID pandemic hit and after. Obviously, it shows that from the time spent in the pandemic and lockdown, it jumped almost 30% in the amount of adults that have reported symptoms of these mental disorders.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

include_graphics("images/adult.webp")


```


### Interpretation

This bar graph is also very explanatory in itself. It just shows how high of an amount of adults report these mental health issue symptoms during the COVID lockdown and also visualizes the effect that these events have taken on mental health.
